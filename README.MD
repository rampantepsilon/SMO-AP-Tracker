## How To Use Tracker

When starting the tracker, you will be prompted with a server information screen. Simply enter all information as you would for the AP Client and connect.

All checks will mark automatically for you. (Currently, you are allowed to still manually fix issues with the autotracker if needed. This might be removed in later builds.)

## Building from source

To build from source, download all project files and use the following commands:

```
npm init
npm i electron@latest
```

This app can also be modified to be hosted on a webserver if you choose to do so.
